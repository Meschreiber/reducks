### Objective

Build a library that replicates the core functionalities of the redux library.

### Getting started

`npm install` then `npm test`

Start at `/tests/createStore.spec.js`. Remember to remove the `x`s from the `xit`s as you work through the specs. Everything from the `enhancers` section and beyond is considered extra credit.

Follow along with the notes prefacing each section and make sure you walk away with a solid understanding how the most essential `createStore` function works. Have fun! ðŸ¦†

#### Foot note
We do not implement the `bindActionCreators` and `combineReducers` functions, as they are primarily convenience methods provided by the redux library. If you are curious, feel free to dig through their source code and try to implement it yourself!
