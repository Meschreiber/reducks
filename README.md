### Objective

Build a library that replicates the core functionalities of the redux library.

### Getting started

`npm install` then `npm test`

Start at `/tests/createStore.spec.js`. Remember to remove the `x`s from the `xit`s as you work through the specs. Everything from the `enhancers` section and beyond is considered extra credit. The `enhancers` section on `createStore.spec.js`, `compose.spec.js`, and `applyMiddleware.spec.js` should be completed in order. Otherwise, `bindActionCreators.spec.js` and `combineReducers.spec.js` are not interdependent and may be completed as you please.

Follow along with the notes prefacing each section and make sure you walk away with a solid understanding how the most essential `createStore` function works. Have fun! ðŸ¦†
